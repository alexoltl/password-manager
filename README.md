# password-manager
manages passwords securely by encryption, will update soon.

this uses cryptography-fernet to encrypt and decrypt passwords with a .key file.
i also use colorama to make the program look nicer.
my next steps are to add a "master password" feature which will be used to unlock the files.
this is my first repo, i don't want to sound pushy but please give constructive critisism.
