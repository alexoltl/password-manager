# password-manager
manages passwords securely by encryption, will update soon.

this uses cryptography-fernet to encrypt and decrypt passwords with a .key file.
i also use colorama to make the program look nicer.


my next steps are to add a "master password" feature which will be used to unlock the files.
this is my first repo, i don't want to sound pushy but please give constructive critisism.


26/4/22: currently, the code works as intended, you need a master password to unlock all the passwords but now if you put in the wrong master password, the program just crashes. i don't know why. i'm still gonna continue coding but i'm very close.
