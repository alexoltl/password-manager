# password-manager
manages passwords, will update soon.

this uses cryptography and fernet to encrypt and decrypt passwords with a .key file.
my next steps are to add a "master passowrd" feature which will be used to unlock the files.
this is my first repo, i don't want to sound pushy but please give constructive critisism.
